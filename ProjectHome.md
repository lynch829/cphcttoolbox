A Collection of open source CT tools developed mainly at the University of Copenhagen.

We have implemented CPU and GPU versions of a few popular reconstruction algorithms for common scan patterns. The code is released under the open source GPL v2 license so you can [download](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cphcttoolbox) and try it out for yourself.
The release includes a [README](http://cphcttoolbox.googlecode.com/hg/README) with background and install notes and [user instructions](http://cphcttoolbox.googlecode.com/hg/doc/instructions.pdf) with complete examples.

We use the toolbox ourselves for education, research and in the industrial collaborations we participate in. The [DYI CT scanner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLdNSgDne3I) that one of our students built from laid-off parts is just one example of the educational applications of the toolbox.
