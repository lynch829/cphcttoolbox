    Parameters
    ----------
    conf : dict

    data : gpuarray
        Data matrix to square.
    out : gpuarray, optional
        Output argument. 
        This must have the exact kind that would be returned 
        if it was not used.
        In particular, it must have the right type, must be C-contiguous,
        and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned 
        for without *out* set.
        This is a performance feature. 
        Therefore, if these conditions are not met,
        an exception is raised,  instead of attempting to be flexible.
    
    Returns
    -------
    output : gpuarray
        Returns squared ndarray.
