Description: Copenhagen Computed Tomography Toolbox is a collection of
        applications and libraries for flexible and efficient CT reconstruction. The
        toolbox apps generally take a set of projections (X-ray intensity measurements) and
        filter and back project them in order to recreate the image or volume that the
        projections represent.
        The project includes both mostly informative CPU implementations and highly efficient
        GPU implementations.
